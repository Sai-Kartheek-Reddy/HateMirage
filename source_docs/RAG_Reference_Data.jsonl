{"topic": "china_covid_bioweapon", "chunk_id": "ccb_001", "text": "One of the earliest conspiracy theories that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic claimed that China had intentionally engineered and released the virus as a bioweapon. The theory often centered around the Wuhan Institute of Virology, where scientists had been studying coronaviruses. Detractors cited the lab's proximity to the initial outbreak and speculated that a leak—intentional or accidental—was the real cause. While scientists have investigated this lab-leak possibility, no credible evidence has surfaced to support the notion that COVID-19 was a bioweapon. Nonetheless, this theory gained political traction globally, especially in the U.S., where some officials promoted it during election cycles.", "tags": ["covid-19", "china", "wuhan", "bioweapon", "lab leak"]}
